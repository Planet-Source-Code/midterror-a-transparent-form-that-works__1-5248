## A Transparent Form That Works\!


</div>

### Description

This is something I made after seeing people request a way to make transparent forms. The nice thing about this though, is that it makes it so that all the controls are still visible! And it works with transparent shapes and lines too! This is a great way to make your programs stand out from the rest, you have to see it.
